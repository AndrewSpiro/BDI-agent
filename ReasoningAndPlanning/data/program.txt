#In the think step, your agent evaluates the program rules.
#It does so by doing inference on the union of the program rules (this file) and the belief base.
#The program rules define how and when actions need to be added to the intentions, goals need to be addopted and beliefs needs to be added or deleted
#Actions are defined by the operators +-~_. See the assignment for an explanantion of these operators.
#The conditions of a rule are the preconditions, just like any other rule. The conclusion of the rule contains the action(s) and/or facts that can be derived with inference.
#Actions are not used during inference as new facts (i.e., they cannot unify with the knowledge base), 
#They are processed by the agent as new facts into the appropriate knowledge bases (beliefs, desires, intentions).
#The exception is the addition action, of which the predicate is added to the facts during inference.
#Add your program rules below:

#Open a door at a location with a specific key
pos(X)&lockedAt(X,K)&hasKey(K)>_open(X,K)

#Grab a key whenever you see one
pos(X)&keyAt(X,K)>_grab(X,K)

#Move to a location if a link to that location is known
!=(X,Y)&pos(X)&link(X,Y)>_goto(X,Y)

#Adopt the goal to have the key K if there is a locked door with that key
lockedAt(X,K)&!hasKey(K)>*haveKey(K)

#Adopt the goal to open the door once you have a key corresponding to a door
lockedAt(X,K)&hasKey(K)>*openDoor(X,K)

#Adopt the goal to explore unexplored tiles
link(X,Y)&!explored(Y)>*explore(Y)

#TODO: maybe we can put some recursive predicate here that determines the next node after the current position
#depending on the links toward a goal or desires
